# coderefactoring
For this code refactoring project, I went into the <a href="https://britaniwalley.github.io/coderefactoring/">Horiseon</a> site's code that was given to us at the beginning of the class week. My first step was to go through and make sure the HTML elements followed the rules of semantic HTML, which involed removing the unnecessary <div> tags. While doing this, I also added some alt attributes so that the site was up to accessibility standards. Next, I addressed the sequential order in which all tags were in. This included making sure all heading tags fell in the proper order. 

After the HTML was edited, I addressed the CSS. To do this I went in and first changed any styling calls that had been changed in the HTML. Then I went through and combined any styling that applied to multiple classes. After that, I went in and commented all necessary sections of the styling so that it could be reviewed later. I triple checked that this worked through both provided links and GitHub. Once this was done, I created my ReadMe.md and submitted!
